# AirBnB-Berlin-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
In this project, we'll work with AirBnB listings data from Germany, Berlin.
We will pursue the following steps:
1. Set an original data science use case/question (You can investigate the data from the perspective of a listings owner, customer or Airbnb stuff etc. It depends on what you want to explore and find out in the data)
2. Prepare the data based on your case/question
3. Analyse and explore your data 
4. Create a presentation of your work and submit it along with your code in Jupyter notebook.
